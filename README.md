# Overview

## Initial Setup

After cloning this repo, there are five steps to setup bayesrest:
1. Setup nginx-proxy
1. Add to /etc/hosts
1. Create a `.bdb` file
1. Create a config file
1. Start the app

### Setup probcomp/nginx-proxy repo

Follow the instructions at https://github.com/probcomp/nginx-proxy -- nginx-proxy must be running before you can access bayesrest.

### Add /etc/hosts entry (if you don't already have one)

    echo "127.0.0.1 bayesrest.probcomp.dev" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts


## Running

### create a `.bdb` file
BayesREST requires that you provide it a `.bdb` file for which analysis has already been performed. Rename that file `database.bdb` and place it at the project root.

### Start the app

    make up

(Use the --build option if you've made docker changes.)

Service is accessible at `https://bayesrest.probcomp.dev:8443` (though the TLS-terminating nginx proxy) and `http://localhost:5000` (directly)

### Configuration

BayesREST should work out-of-the-box without further configuration, using example "counties" data and the loom backend. If you'd like to use other data or backends, read on.

BayesREST is configured via a `.yaml` file, with some settings able to be overwritten with environment variables. If you're running in a docker context, you should edit the existing `docker-compose.yml` file to change environment variables as needed. Otherwise, copy `config-example.yaml` to `config.yaml`, and make changes there. The values you may configure (and their environment variable equivalent) are:

- `bdb_file` / `BDB_FILE`: The filename of the `.bdb` file to issue queries against (which must be in the local directory)
- `log_level` / `LOG_LEVEL`: The log level for the application. Valid options are `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `NOTSET`.
- `table_name` / `TABLE_NAME`: The table containing the data under analysis.
- `population_name` / `POPULATION_NAME`: The name of the population in your `.bdb` file
- `backend` / `BACKEND`: Choose either `loom` or `cgpm`
- `loom_path` / `LOOM_PATH`: The path to loom-specific data.

In the `gunicorn` section, you can configure:

- `bind`: The IP and address the server should bind to.
- `workers`: The number of preforked worker processes
- `timeout`: The number of seconds requests may take before returning an error. On slower machines, you may need to increase the default value of 30 seconds.
- `reload`: A boolean- if set True, will cause gunicorn to watch source files and reload if the application changes (useful for development)

After changing configuration, `make up` will start your app in a docker container.

### Example request

    curl --request POST \
      --url http://localhost:5000/find-peers \
      --header 'content-type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "context-column": "operator_owner",
        "target-row": 10
     }'

### development

The docker container mounts and runs out of this directory, and by default the server is configured to watch for source file changes, so your changes will generally be immediately visibile in the running container.

The container will crash on some bad syntax errors. Simply restart it in those instances.

You'll need to rebuild your Docker container if you change requirements.

### documentation

Docs are autogenerated from the API spec. We're using [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/cli/README.md) to do just that.

To rebuild docs, you'll need to install redoc-cli first:

    npm install -g redoc-cli

Then you can rebuild documentation with:

    make docs
